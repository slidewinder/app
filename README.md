# app
The slidewinder web/desktop app

Note: this is currently pre-alpha and under active development. Bugs are to be expected at this stage, and there's no need to report them to us until we make the first release.

### Installation

You'll need to install Meteor first:

```bash
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

Then clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/slidewinder/app.git slidewinder_app

```

### Running

Now move into the meteor app directory and run it:

```bash
cd slidewinder_app/slidewinder
meteor

```

You can now access the app at http://localhost:3000
